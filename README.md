# Equator Weather Analysis

Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

# Part 1: WeatherPy
Create a Python script to visualise the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator using the citipy Python library Links to an external site, the OpenWeatherMap API Links to an external site, and my problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

- Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
- Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
- After each pair of plots, explain what the linear regression is modelling. Describe any relationships noticed and any other findings uncovered.

# Part 2: VacationPy
Use the above weather data to plan future vacation using Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.

- The main tasks will be to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ Python skills to create map visualisations.
